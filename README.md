# Wine-Quality-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-with-Python

🍷 Wine Quality Prediction with Machine Learning 🤖📊

This project leverages machine learning techniques in Python to predict the quality of wines based on various features. Uncork the potential insights hidden in the dataset, which includes information about different physicochemical properties of red and white wines.

Features:

-📊 Data Exploration: Analyzed and visualized the dataset to uncork insights into the distribution and relationships between different features.

-🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for training, handling missing values, and scaling numerical features.

-⚙️ Model Selection: Implemented and compared multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.

-📏 Evaluation Metrics: Utilized metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.
